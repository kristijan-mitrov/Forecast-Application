## 📊 Idea & Plan
Simple Android Application used to check out the weather and forecast for your curent or other loaction. Data that would like to display are: 
   - Temperature (minimum & maximum) 🌡️
   - Humidity 💧
   - Wind Speed 💨
   - Pressure 📈
   
Additionaly we would like to display an weather icon which depends of the current weather state. For example we would display a sun ☀️ if its sunny and a cloud ☁️ if its coloudy...
 
 ## 🌤️ Features
 The user would be able to choose a location on a map (Open Street Map) or type in the name of the location in a search fild and find it that way. Additionally the user can checkout the forecast for the next 5 days.
 
 ## 👩‍💻 API & Data
 The information and data that we will display in our application will be fetched from the [OpenWeatherApi](https://openweathermap.org/api)
 
 ## 📱 Technologies we are using
   - Figma for design
   - Android Studio
   - Kotlin
   - MVVM architecture
   - Open Street Map
